Greedy algorithm is usually a good choice for dynamic programming or optimisation problems. It's simple, covers a wide range of problems.

Minimum-spanning-tree (MST) algorithms, Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths, and a greedy set-covering heruistic are the applications of greedy algorithms.

Like I said at former, you should prerequisite dynamic programming.

Let me introduce the cases;

1. Simple and non-trivial problem
2. Basic elements of the greedy approach
3. Important application of greedy techniques
4. Problem case: Which blocks to replace when a miss occurs in a cache

### Activity-selection Problem - Simple, but important
