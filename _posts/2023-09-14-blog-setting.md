## Newbie's First Blogging - I'm a Dumb

<!--- Due to a plugin called `jekyll-titles-from-headings` which is supported by GitHub Pages by default. The above header (in the markdown file) will be automatically used as the pages title.

If the file does not start with a header, then the post title will be derived from the filename.
 
This is a sample blog post. You can talk about all sorts of fun things here. --->

1. I got a template from [this blog](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html). I wanted to set up my blog by following the documents of Github and Jekyll step by step, but I felt as if I had wasted too much time. Of course, all those are my experiences, but I wanted to post what I have learned quickly.

2. To be used to markdown syntax is essential. It's simple. Additionally, I started to use Obsidian, which uses markdown.

3. See you again!

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```
