## Welcome.

My name is Joonhyeok Kwon (권준혁). Just call me Joon.

On this blog, I will share my insights, challenges, and achievements in computer vision and other topics that interest me. I hope you will find my posts informative and engaging.

I'm a third-year student pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science and industrial engineering.

I'm from South Korea and native Korean. I can speak English fluently and French at a beginner level.

I'm passionate about computer vision and I have experience in using Python, C++, and OpenCV.

I also enjoy singing and I'm a vocalist in my school band.
